\chapter*{Abstract}

The main objective of this work is predicting how a robot soccer team whill behave, based
on a set of positions and orientations of a discrete sample. For that, some heuristics were
studied: ACO (Ant Colony Optimization), SA (Simulated Annealing), GA (Genetic Algorithm),
and Neural Networks. Based on the detailed study of these algorithms two branches were defined
as candidate solutions: one based on the Neural Network heuristics, and the other based on
Fuzzy logic. After a deeper study on of these methods it's desirable to implement an algori-
thm which will refinethe result.
